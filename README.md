# Pydict Weather Full Stack

This application is the implementation of my previous application that collects and displays weather forecast data. 
This time, I implemented a Full Stack Web APplication, using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) to create a Back End Server and ReactJS (and the library Antd) to create a Front End Server.
